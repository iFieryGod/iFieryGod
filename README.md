- 👋 Hi, I’m @iFieryGod
- 👀 I’m interested in building whatever my mind is able to think of.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css, javascript, vuejs, postgresql, mongodb, python and other stuff not related to the world of software development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate or learn about any projects small or medium that revolve around real-time data transfer, event handling, database structuring and management, error handling, game design concepts in websites.
